# Track Map React-TS Project

This project, **Track Map React-TS**, is developed by crbzxy and utilizes React, TypeScript, and Vite to create an efficient development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint for code quality. It's designed to showcase a map tracking feature, leveraging the leaflet library for map rendering and custom utilities for geospatial operations.

## Project Structure

The project follows a structured approach to organize its components, utilities, and configurations:

- `.eslintrc.cjs` - Configurations for ESLint.
- `.git/` - Git version control related files.
- `.gitignore` - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `index.html` - The entry HTML file.
- `package-lock.json` & `package.json` - Node.js dependencies and scripts.
- `public/` - Public assets including `vite.svg`.
- `src/` - Source files including:
  - `App.css` & `App.tsx` - Main app styling and TypeScript component.
  - `assets/` - Static assets like images.
  - `components/` - Reusable React components.
    - `molecules/` - Smaller components like `Mapa.tsx`.
    - `organism/` - Larger components like `MapaContenedor.tsx`.
  - `utils/` - Utility functions like `geoUtils.ts` for geospatial calculations.
- `tsconfig.json` & `tsconfig.node.json` - TypeScript configuration.
- `vite.config.ts` - Configuration for Vite.

## Features

- **React + TypeScript**: Utilizes the power of React combined with TypeScript for strong typing.
- **Vite**: Employs Vite for fast development and build processes.
- **Leaflet**: For rendering interactive maps and handling geospatial data.
- **ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency with custom ESLint rules.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/track-map-react-ts.git
cd track-map-react-ts
npm install
```

Run the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the project with:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Expanding the ESLint Configuration

For production applications, consider enhancing the ESLint configuration for type-aware linting rules. Adjust `parserOptions` in `.eslintrc.cjs` and explore adding more strict rules for TypeScript and React specific linting.

## Dependencies

- React and ReactDOM for UI.
- Leaflet for map functionalities.
- TypeScript for static type checking.
- Vite and its plugins for an optimized development setup.
- ESLint and its plugins for code quality.

For a complete list of dependencies and their purposes, refer to `package.json`.
